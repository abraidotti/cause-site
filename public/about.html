<p>Hurricane Maria is the worst Dominica natural disaster in recorded history. It is also the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puetro Rico since 1928. The damange and death in the aftermath of the storm was devastating and will affect the islands of the Puerto Rico for months and years to come. The cries of help from the people on the leveled island have been heard around the world. This devastating event has been left mostly ignored despite the mayor of Puerto Rico making a plea to the United States to send help. Please do not ignore the cries of the citizens of Puerto Rico. For more information please advance to the next page for information on how you can help out. </p>
