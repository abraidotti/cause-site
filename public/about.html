    <div class="wrapper"><p><strong> Hurricane Maria</strong>  is the <em>worst</em> Dominica natural disaster in recorded history. It is also the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puetro Rico since 1928. The damange and death in the aftermath of the storm was devastating and will affect the islands
      of <strong>Puerto Rico</strong> for months and years to come. The cries of help from the people on the leveled island have been heard around the world. This devastating event has been left mostly <em>ignored</em> despite the mayor of San Juan making a plea to the United
      States to send help. Please do not ignore the cries of the citizens of Puerto Rico. For more information please advance to the next page for information on how you can help out. </p>
